'''
There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.
'''
def uniquePaths(m: int, n: int) -> int:
    dp = [[1]*n for _ in range(m)]
    # for base cases first row and first column have only one way to reach the end on both sides
    # we will start with 1 row 1 column
    for r in range(1, m):
        for c in range(1, n):
            dp[r][c] = dp[r-1][c] + dp[r][c-1]
    
    return dp[-1][-1]

'''
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
'''
def longestCommonSubsequence(text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
    # increased the length to accomodate for the base case of empty strings
    m = len(text1) + 1
    n = len(text2) + 1

    dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]

    for i in range(1,m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j],dp[i][j-1])
    return dp[-1][-1]
